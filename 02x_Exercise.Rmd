## Exercise: Farm Data Analysis

In this exercise, you will work through a typical data analysis workflow using the `02_df_farm_v2.csv` data file we created in class. In this exercise, you will explore the differences in fertilizer use and farm yield among rich, mid, and poor income countries.

Follow this general template, write your own code and modify as needed to document your own work.

## Workspace setup

### Start with a clean workspace

```{r}

```

### Load packages

```{r}

```

## Import Data

### Import data from files

```{r}
# import file "./results/02_dat_farm_v2.csv"

```

### Create new datasets

```{r}
# create a new dataframe with data only from high-income country

# create a new dataframe with data only from mid-income country

# create a new dataframe with data only from low-income country

```

### Summary statistics

```{r}
# dataframe structure

```

```{r}
# Use the stargazer function to generate well-formated summary statistics

```

## Simple plots

```{r}
# Histogram for high-income country

# Histogram for mid-income country

# Histogram for low-income country

```

```{r}
# Scatterplots


```

## Simple regression

### OLS

```{r}
# Run OLS separately for three income groups

```

## Export results

Since we created new variables, we might wish to save the new datasets into new csv files

```{r}
# Write data to csv file

```

Write summary statistics into txt file

```{r}
# Data summary statistics

```

Write the regression table into txt file

```{r}
# Regression results

```
